# Week 7 Homework: Moonlight Festival Control Booth

## Summary

This homework uses Python’s `heapq` module to manage festival alerts based on priority. Each alert has a number where smaller values mean more urgent. The program processes alerts in the correct order, handles ties, and can return the top K alerts. It also includes a function to check the next alert without changing the original list.

---

## Approach

### `order_festival_alerts`

* I used a min heap (`heapq`) to store alerts.
* Each heap item was a tuple like `(priority, title)`.
* I pushed all alerts into the heap, then popped them one by one.
* As I popped items, I added only the title to the result list.

---

### `order_festival_alerts_stable`

* I handled ties by adding an index to each item.
* Each heap item looked like `(priority, index, title)`.
* If two priorities are the same, the index keeps the original order.
* Input order matters because we want earlier alerts first when priorities match.

---

### `top_k_festival_alerts`

* I used a heap and only removed the first `k` elements.
* This gives the most urgent alerts.
* If `k <= 0`, I returned an empty list.
* If `k` is larger than the list, I returned all alerts.

---

### `peek_next_festival_alert`

* I made a copy of the original list so it is not changed.
* Then I used `heapify()` to turn it into a heap.
* I returned the first element without popping it.
* If the list is empty, I returned `None`.

## Complexity

### `order_festival_alerts`

* **Time:** O(n log n)
* **Space:** O(n)
* **Why:** inserting and removing from heap takes log n time and we do it n times.

---

### `order_festival_alerts_stable`

* **Time:** O(n log n)
* **Space:** O(n)
* **Why:** same as above, but with an extra index stored.

---

### `top_k_festival_alerts`

* **Time:** O(n log n)
* **Space:** O(n)
* **Why:** building the heap takes O(n), removing k items takes O(k log n).

---

### `peek_next_festival_alert`

* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(n)
* **Why:** copying the list and heapifying both take linear time.

## Edge-case checklist

### `order_festival_alerts`

* [x] empty input
* [x] one alert
* [x] multiple different priorities

### `order_festival_alerts_stable`

* [x] same-priority tie
* [x] all same priority
* [x] empty input

### `top_k_festival_alerts`

* [x] `k = 0`
* [x] `k > len(alerts)`
* [x] duplicate priorities
* [x] empty input

### `peek_next_festival_alert`

* [x] empty input
* [x] normal case

---

## Test notes

* I tested normal and edge cases using pytest.
* I checked that heap order works correctly.
* I made sure original input is not modified in peek function.

## Assistance & Sources

### AI used?

* [x] Yes

If yes, what did it help with?

* Helped explain heap usage and structure the code clearly.
* Helped verify edge cases and test coverage.

### Other sources

* Python documentation for `heapq`
* Class notes

## Reflection

What was hardest?

* Understanding how to keep order when priorities are the same.

What do you understand better now?

* How heaps work and how to use them as a priority queue.
* How to handle edge cases properly.
